## How to Run All Assignments Together

A script named `run_all.py` is included in this folder to run all assignments one by one automatically.

To run all assignments:

1. Open terminal or VS Code.
2. Run the command:

## python run_all.py

This will execute all assignment files sequentially and show their outputs in the terminal.
